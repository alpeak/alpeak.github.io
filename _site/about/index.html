    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Magnolia is located north of downtown Chicago in the newly revitalized neighborhood of Uptown. Beautiful pictures of Magnolia flowers line the walls of this intimate American Bistro. The atmosphere is cozy and conversation friendly with lively jazz music playing softly in the background. One can enjoy many of the unique cocktails served at Magnolia’s bar or indulge in any of their small production, boutique bottles of wine. Steak and fish dishes are prepared with a stylish twist and choosing one dish from another is quite the challenge. </p>
    <p>The restaurant welcomes all size reservations. Magnolia often hosts wine dinners where Chef Kasra Medhat prepares a unique menu to be paired with numerous wines. Private parties are available by reservation and offsite catering can be arranged through our general manager, Sue Grena. Gift certificates are also available. </p>
    <p>Since its opening in December of 2001, owner and chef Kasra Medhat thrives in delivering his recipe for great service and a delightful culinary adventure. Neighborhood regulars all describe Magnolia as an incredible dining experience and a warm and inviting place not to be missed when looking for a truly memorable dinner. Magnolia is not only loved by visitors, but is the favorite dining spot of the locals of Uptown as well.</p>
    <p>Valet parking is available on Friday and Saturday nights as well as busy holidays (Call in advance about holiday valet parking.) Otherwise, surrounding streets are non-permit zoned and provide ample parking.</p>

    <h3>Meet the Chef</h3>
    <p>As a kid growing up in Oak Brook, Medhat’s main exposure to cooking was through his Turkish father (“a grill man”) and his Iranian mother (“lots of rice dishes and vegetables”). He graduated in 1990 from Hinsdale Central High school, where he played singles tennis and was part of a state championship squad his senior year. After high school he moved to Winter Park, Florida, to attend Rollins College, where he gave up tennis in favor of a busy social life and graduated with an environmental studies major.  Soon after he enrolled at Evanston’s Kendall College culinary school in 1996.</p>
    <p>Medhat’s passion earned him an internship at Spruce, where opening chef Keith Luce ran a tight ship and taught him how to think like a professional. “He was knowledgeable about wine, vegetables etc. He did everything, including pastries.” Medhat ended up staying for two and a half years, learning more about the front of the house from Spruce’s owner Dan Sacks.  Medhat left Spruce just before it closed. For the next six months he held some odd jobs in catering and worked as a butcher at a friend’s grocery store in the Pilsen neighborhood.  In July 2001, his brother noticed that the old Earth Market space at 1224 W. Wilson was available.  Shortly thereafter Magnolia Cafe opened in December of 2001.</p>
